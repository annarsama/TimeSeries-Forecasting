# Time Series Forecasting

This is the final project for a Time Series Forecasting 💻 lesson from Master 2 SISE at the _Université Lumière Lyon 2_. The aim of this project was to forecast **electricity consumption**, which is a time serie, using R.

## Data 📊

The file `2023-11-Elec-train.xlsx` contains **electricity consumption** and **outdoor air temperature**. These quantities are measured every 15 minutes, from 1/1/2010 1:15 to 2/20/2010 23:45. In addition, outdoor air temperature are available for 2/21/2010. 

## Objective 📍

The goal is to forecast electricity consumption for 2/21/2010 (96 last values) using outdoor air temperature and not using it. Moreover, this project is exploratory and I had to run several machine learning algorithms to forecast electricity consumption.
